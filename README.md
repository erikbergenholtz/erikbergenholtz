### Hey, I'm Erik!

I'm a penetration tester and all around nerd with a special interest for
hacking IBM mainframes. I've also done some research while working towards my
Ph.D. in computer science (a project that's currently on hold), where I've
focused on malware analysis and malware obfuscation techniques. A list of my
published work can be found on my [website](http://escalatedquickly.se).

Apart from hacking mainframes and picking apart malware, I'm also very
interested in web and system security, cryptography, and physical security.

Outside of security, I have a deep interest for formal languages, system
programming, and programming in general. Since I discovered the wonderful world
of mainframes, I have of course extended these topics into that domain, and
have taken the first stumbles into the world of COBOL, REXX and HLASM.
