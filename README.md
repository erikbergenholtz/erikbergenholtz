### Hey, I'm Erik!

I'm a security researcher currently working on my Ph.D. in computer science, with a focus on malware analysis.
A list of my published work can be found on my [website](http://erikbergenholtz.se).

In the security field, I am of course very interested in malware analysis and reverse engineering. In particular,
I'm interested in obfuscation techniques used by malware. I'm also very interested in web and systems security,
cyrptography, as well as physical security.

Outside of security, I have a deep interest for formal languages, systems programming, and programming in
general.
